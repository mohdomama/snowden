# A Symmetric E2EE Android App
Its a simple android app that uses DES encryption to encrypt text. The encrypted text can then be shared to anyone without worrying about middleman attack or eavesdropping. Only the person with the "key" will be able to decrypt it. Currently the app works with API level 23 or higher. Hence marshmallow is the minimum requirement.
